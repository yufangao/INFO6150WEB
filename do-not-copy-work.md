# Do not copy work!

For the INFO6150 class, do not copy the work of others.

I _encourage_ you to look at the work of your fellow students and various sources online.  There is a lot you can learn from reading the code of others.

However, for assignments, exams, and projects, please ONLY turn in code you yourself have written yourself, except where explicitly allowed.  This class covers a lot of fundamental knowledge and it is important to for you to exercise those fundamentals.

To be clear: when "referencing" other code
- Learn how it works
- Then write your own code without looking at that original source
- Do NOT cut-and-paste to make changes
- Do NOT use someone else's code as a skeleton or starting point
- This includes code generated by tools - write it yourself

Even sample code provided by the instructor should not be cut-and-pasted unless the assignment requests you to do so
- Instead, learn HOW it does it, and write your own code to do it in a similar fashion
- The resulting code may be almost identical, but writing it yourself (and making any necessary adjustments) is IMPORTANT

Failure to follow this requirement can and will result in strict penalties, up to and including
- receiving a zero grade on the assignment in question
- failing the course
- being expelled from the university

All of which is not unique to this course, as noted in the Student Ethics guidelines you have all agreed to.
