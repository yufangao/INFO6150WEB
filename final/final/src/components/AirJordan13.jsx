                                This model had a carbon fiber plate, designed by Hatfield. The Black Panther was the inspiration for the Air Jordan XIII, with the sole resembling the pads on a panther's paw. A hologram on the back of the shoe imitates a panther's eyes in the dark. They were re-released in 2005, which coincided with the release of the Air Jordan 8s shoe.
